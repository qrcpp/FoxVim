## Philosophy. The Eternal Quest for Individuality

### "Shackles" of Convenience:

In our pursuit of perfection and pragmatism, we've grown accustomed to tools that promise maximum convenience. However, this illusion of a "ready-made" world conceals limitations and a dependency on someone else's vision. Pre-configured setups for Neovim, like seductive illusions, offer us convenience while hiding the true essence. In the chase for "ideal customization," the developers of these setups forget that a person is not a template but a unique creation, and an "ideal" universal approach is impossible. They simply take away the freedom to independently create one's own path. In this "convenience," there lies a danger: we may become dependent on ready-made solutions, giving up the eternal search for our own way.

Imagine a ready-made house - fully furnished, with perfect lighting. Convenient, but it deprives you of the opportunity to create a space that reflects your individuality and inner world. Neovim setups are similar. They offer the convenience of a ready configuration but deprive you of the opportunity to independently adjust the editor to your individual needs. There arises an anxiety: "Am I capable of creating my own world in this virtual space?".

### The Illusion of Customization:

Setups offer the illusion of customization, but it is limited by the boundaries set by the creators. We can tweak the details, but the fundamental principles remain unchanged, making the user dependent on their logic. It's like a predefined route that you cannot deviate from. We can change the details, but not the direction.

Many setups, such as AstroNvim, LazyVim, and NvChad, offer extensive customization options. We can choose color schemes, icons, add plugins. But all this happens within the structure defined by the developers. Setups, like fog, envelop the structure, leading the user into a labyrinth of tangled plugins and inaccessible settings. The focus on user "convenience" becomes their prison, taking away the freedom of choice and control. We're just playing with blocks, but we're not able to change the rules of the game. In this illusion of freedom, there lurks an anxiety: "What if we made the wrong choice?".

### The Search for True Freedom as the Eternal Quest for Identity:

We strive for true freedom, for the ability to create a tool that reflects our individuality. We want the tool to serve us, not the other way around. We want to be the architects of our own environment, not just tenants. In this aspiration, there is uncertainty: "What if we can't create what we want? Can we handle the complexity of independent setup?".

Freedom is not the choice from pre-defined options. It is the possibility to create something new, something of our own, reflecting our individuality. We don't want to be clones; we want to be ourselves, and our tools should reflect this individuality. Freedom is not just the right to choose, but also the right to create. But in this creation, there is fear: "What if we create something wrong, something unsuccessful?".

### foxvim: Liberation from the "Shackles" of Convenience:

foxvim is not just a setup, but a philosophy. A philosophy of freedom, customization, and convenience. It does not offer a ready solution but gives the opportunity to independently choose your own path. It provides freedom of choice and control over your own environment. But freedom always carries a risk: "What if we make the wrong choice?".

foxvim is an open system that does not try to impose its will. It provides tools for creating your own environment. We can adjust everything, from the color scheme to the behavior of plugins. It's not just a set of settings; it's the opportunity to create your own world. But even in this possibility, there is anxiety: what if we create a world in which we are not comfortable?..
